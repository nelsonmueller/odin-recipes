        <p>Whether they’re plain or bejeweled with pieces of strawberry and rhubarb, “drop biscuits”
            are the easiest type of biscuits to make — and feature a wonderfully tender, moist texture. 
            So, what’s the catch? They’re not really biscuits. Or, at least they’re not like the classic, 
            flaky, southern-style biscuits that most of us imagine when we think of biscuits. These are 
            much more scone-like, which isn’t an issue, unless you want an actual biscuit.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <h5>Fruit Mixture:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cup cubed rhubarb</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups cubed strawberries</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Dough:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons reserved fruit syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cold buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Egg Wash, optional:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lemon icing drizzle, optional</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup packed powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps to the Drop Biscuits:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Drain fruit in a strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Grate frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4 cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit is coated with flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Scoop or spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 9: </strong>Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing. Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.</li>
