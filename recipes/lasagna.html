        <h3>Steps to the John Wayne Casserole:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the crust: </strong>Press the biscuit dough in the bottom and up the sides of a prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the meat: </strong>Cook the beef until crumbly. Drain the fat, stir in seasoning and water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer. Transfer the meat to a bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the veggies: </strong>In the same pan, cook the sliced onions and peppers until tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the creamy layer: </strong>Combine the sour cream, mayo, 1/2 of the Cheddar, and 1/2 of the cooked veggies in a bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer and bake the casserole: </strong>Layer the meat, tomatoes, onion-pepper mixture, jalape√±os, and sour cream mixture on top of the biscuit dough. Sprinkle it with cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is browned and bubbly.</li>
